# ADT-FrontList

Consider an ADT FrontList, which restricts insertions, removals, and retrievals to the first item in the list. Define and implement the class FrontList in the following three different ways:

1. Store the list’s entries in an instance of LinkedLis

2. Derive the class FrontList from LinkedList using public inherence.

3. Derive the class FrontList from LinkedList using private inherence.

Write a tester for each FrontList class you defined by following the programs that test sorted list class on D2L.  Compile the tester program using g++ tester.cpp Please make sure all header files include their corresponding implementation files.

Summary:
This program uses a linked list of integers that tests the specification members of the specified FrontList class.
